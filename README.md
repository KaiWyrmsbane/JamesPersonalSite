## My personal website used to market my skill sets when it comes to software/web development.

 This project will be used as a marketing tool for my skill sets while networking with people from companies, or potential freelance employers. So I expect my project to demonstrate my versatility when it comes to software/web development.

using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll present:

* Home page - saying what I do.
* About page - telling the viewer a little about myself.
* Projects page - allowing the viewer to see some of the projects I've done in the past.
* Resume page - so potential employers can view my work history, education, and experience level.
* Contact page - So potential employers, or peers can reach out with new opportunities.
